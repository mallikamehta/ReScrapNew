            <h1><u><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Five Reasons People Don’t
                            Recycle</strong></span></u></h1>

            <p><strong>1. It’s inconvenient</strong></p>

            <p>The reality is that many residential pockets are located far from recycling pick-up points,
                so homeowners have to make a bit of a trek from their driveway. For some, this is
                inconvenient and keeps them from recycling like everyone else. But we all know that
                gathering items for recycling and making that short walk to the nearest pick-up point is a
                small price to pay for a greener planet, right?2.</p>

            <p><strong>2. No space</strong></p>

            <p>Recycling at home means having separate bins for segregating different waste materials.
                Unfortunately, for some, hanging on to recyclables for a few days means taking up space or
                dealing with an eyesore. On the upside, there’s a simple fix for that—you can stay clean and
                organized at home by keeping recyclables in a separate bin that you can easily empty on
                collection day. The little space that separate bins take up is a great way to keep track of
                garbage at home.</p>

            <p><strong>3. I’m not getting paid to recycle</strong></p>

            <p>Sadly, a lot of folks don’t recycle because they’re not getting paid to do it. While some
                places pay people a small amount for rounding up used bottles for recycling, the incentive
                just isn’t that great for some. But do we really need to get paid to look after our waste,
                make sure it’s disposed of properly, and make an effort to separate the recyclables? Not
                only does recycling help you live a better, greener life, but when done right, you can even
                save money as you find objects to repurpose. Now, who said recycling doesn’t pay?</p>

            <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>It doesn’t make a difference</strong></p>

            <p>Another reason why people don’t recycle is simply that they think that there’s no more hope
                left. For them, there’s no point in recycling because they’ve heard that landfills are now
                overfilled and climate change is irreversible. But what’s going to happen if all of us just
                gave up on recycling? The fact is that refusing to recycle and live an eco-friendly
                lifestyle will only speed up all the environmental decline, leaving us in dire conditions
                much sooner.</p>

            <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>It’s</strong><strong> too hard</strong></p>

            <p>It sounds infuriating, but some people can’t be bothered to recycle just because they think
                it’s hard. We know—noone gets those bins right the first time, but that doesn’t mean you
                should stop there. Sure, figuring out where plastic, paper, and organic waste goes can sound
                daunting at first, but it gets easier! There are a ton of recycling guides out there to help
                you get started, and even assistance from waste disposal service providers such as Gorilla
                Bins who can set you up with the bins and recycling services you need.</p>

            <p> </p>

            <h1><span style="font-size:14px;"><u><strong>Five Reasons You Should Recycle</strong></u></span>
            </h1>

            <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Save</strong><strong> Energy</strong></p>

            <p>Did you know that recycling helps to conserve energy? That’s because reusing and repurposing
                recyclables means that manufacturers can produce less, or manufacture products without using
                more raw materials that deplete natural resources. Using recycled materials helps to save on
                energy consumption and reduce production costs, so everybody’s happy.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Reduce landfill use</strong></p>

            <p>When we recycle more, we send less waste to landfills. This stops existing landfills from
                overflowing, forcing new ones to be opened. That means a better living space for everyone in
                the community because no one wants to live next to a landfill.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Protect wildlife</strong></p>

            <p>Recycling helps to maintain good biodiversity. Recycling paper allows us to cut down on the
                number of trees required to make paper, so that means more homes for wildlife. Proper waste
                disposal and segregation of recyclable materials also means less trash polluting the oceans,
                so we can protect marine ecosystems.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Good for the economy</strong></p>

            <p>Recycling isn’t just for the environment, it’s also good for the economy. Producing goods
                using recycled materials means less waste and pollution while consuming less water and
                energy. Plus, the production of recycled goods also creates more demand for them, as more
                and more people are encouraged to opt for the eco-friendly alternative.</p>

            <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Do your part to fight climate change</strong></p>

            <p>Overall, recycling allows us to take part in the battle against climate change. By making use
                of recyclables, the reduced pollution allows us to make our carbon footprint smaller. In the
                long run, this also reduces the amount of unhealthy greenhouse gas emissions. Now if
                everyone just did it, right?</p>
